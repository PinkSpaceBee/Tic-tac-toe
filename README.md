# Tic-tac-toe

It's a simple tic-tac-toe game, and yes, I know I have to cut down on pink. I learned a lot making it, though. My main goal was to familiarize myself with the encapsulation concept a little bit, to move away from the mess of the global code. Honestly, I couldn't even begin to realize how much more convenient it is to have a clear(ish? I'm still new to structuring code, so I'm sure I did a less-than-stellar job) structure to your code before I tried it. 

I used the Module Pattern to separate private methods and variables from the public ones. It took me some tome to get it, but it's an elegant pattern, love it. Can't wait to try and compare it to the ES6 modules. 
Also, I used factory functions as an alternative to constructors. I ended up liking it.

For the styling part, I used Sass. The project is super small, so I could forego Sass and get the same result with plain CSS. But I thought it would't hurt to practice Sass a bit more. To implement responsive layout, I used grid. I love it for its flexibility and an impressive number of features to play with. 

I'm going to move to other projects now, but I'm definitely returning to this tic-tac-toe game to dip into the minimax algorithm, it sounds like so much fun!
