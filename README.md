# Tic-tac-toe
Starting a new project. I intend to:
- document my code better this time
- practice using module pattern 
- get more familiar with factory functions

TO-DO:
1. A player can choose a mark only once. It can't be changed in the middle of a game. 
2. Computer should always choose the mark opposite to the one that a player chose.
