# Tic-tac-toe
Starting a new project. I intend to:
- document my code better this time
- practice using module pattern 
- get more familiar with factory functions

TO-DO:
1. A player can choose a mark only once. It can't be changed in the middle of a game. 
2. Computer should always choose the mark opposite to the one that a player chose.

Well I see now how structuring the code is helpful. Honestly, it's just soooo much more enjoyable and manageable than the mess of global functions and variables. Module pattern though, I'm not so fond of. It's nice and all, but I don't like that it relies on IIFE to be implemented. I can't wait to get familiar with ES6 modules.
